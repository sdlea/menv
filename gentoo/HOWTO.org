  1. xorg-server wont load nvidia-driver
     - use nouveau
     - it turns out xorg-server using config file in /usr/share instead of /etc
     - dont know if a bug or config problem yet
  2. rebuild driver after upgrade kernel, or USE flag
* game controller
  1. it is not a gentoo problem
     before Game or Hardware section created, it stays here for the time being
** kernel driver xpadneo for Gamesir T4 Nova Lite
